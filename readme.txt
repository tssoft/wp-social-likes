== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. Is it possible to place social buttons above the content of the page/post? =

Yes. By default plugin places social buttons after page/post content. We find it reasonable to view content before sharing it with others. 
But you could place buttons before or even before-and-after page/post content using hidden feature:

1. Go to options list of your WordPress site: /wp-admin/options.php
2. Find 'sociallikes_placement' option
3. Assign one of these values to it: before, after, before-after
4. Don't forget to apply changes with 'Save Changes' button

Also you could insert buttons in an excerpt, see question 4 for details.

= 2. Is it possible to use different language (locale) for plugin than the default locale of Wordpress? =

Yes. By default plugin uses the same language (locale) as Wordpress does. 
If there is no translation for this locale, plugin would use English as a default language. We find it suitable for most cases. 
But you could change plugin language (locale) using hidden feature:

1. First of all check whether plugin has translation to your language or not. If it does, go further. If not, contribute translation! :)
2. Go to options list of your WordPress site: /wp-admin/options.php
3. Find 'sociallikes_customlocale' option
4. Assign proper locale to it. (See [list of correct locales](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language))
5. Don't forget to apply changes with 'Save Changes' button

= 3. Is there any shortcode for placing buttons anywhere inside page/post content? =

Yes. In order to use Social Likes shortcodes on your blog, you should first enable this hidden feature on the WordPress advanced options page. 

1. Go to options list of your WordPress site: /wp-admin/options.php
2. Find 'sociallikes_shortcode' option
3. Change its value to 'enabled'. (You can then switch it back to 'disabled' if you wish to turn the shortcodes off)
4. Don't forget to apply changes with 'Save Changes' button

Then, to insert Social Likes button on any position in a post, paste the following code there: [wp-social-likes]

= 4. Is it possible to show Social Likes buttons for post excerpts, not only for full posts? =

Yes. You should just enable this hidden feature on the WordPress advanced options page.

1. Go to options list of your WordPress site: /wp-admin/options.php
2. Find 'sociallikes_excerpts' option
3. Change its value to 'enabled'
4. Don't forget to apply changes with 'Save Changes' button

= 5. Is there a function to display Social Likes buttons anywhere in a theme template? =

Yes, after the Social Likes plugin is activated, you can use these two functions in your themes:

 * *social_likes( $post_id )* - displays Social Likes buttons
 * *get_social_likes( $post_id )* - returns buttons as string

$post_id is an optional argument. You can use it to get buttons for a specific post.

2. Option in editor allows to control appearance of buttons for every post or page 
3. Button style customization with 4 skins, "Icons only" and "Single button" modes
